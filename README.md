<p align="center"> With a trend of shortened attention spans, lack of daily reading, and impending doom scrolling being at an all-time high, IntellectInk seeks to change that. This all-in-one mobile app promotes microlearning and fosters curiosity through bite-sized information tailored to each user’s interests. Organized by topics of interest, it offers short yet impactful snippets of articles, poems, books, breaking news, and the latest research discoveries to make learning a seamless part of one’s daily routine. A built-in reading tracker encourages consistent daily reading, helping users stay motivated and engaged with their reading habits. The app also curates articles and newsletters from diverse viewpoints, empowering users to explore all sides of a topic, fostering critical thinking, and encouraging well-informed, independent opinions.</p>
